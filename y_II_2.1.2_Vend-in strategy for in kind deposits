Research of section 85:
- Section 85 of the Canadian Income Tax Act is a tax-deferral mechanism
- It allows taxpayers to transfer eligible property to a taxable Canadian corporation without triggering immediate capital gains or other tax liabilities
- Known as a "Section 85 rollover," it’s commonly used for business incorporation, corporate reorganizations, or estate planning
- Here’s a practical summary:

What it does:
- Section 85 enables an individual to transfer assets to a Canadian corporation at an "elected amount" rather than the fair market value (FMV)
- This defers taxes that would arise from selling appreciated assets at FMV

Key requirements:
1. Eligible transferor: Individuals, trusts, corporations, or partnerships (with Canadian resident partners)
2. Eligible transferee: Must be a taxable Canadian corporation (taxable in Canada on future asset sales)
3. Eligible property includes:
   - Capital property (e.g., real estate, equipment, shares). BITCOIN??
4. Consideration: The transferor must receive at least one share of the corporation’s stock
5. Joint Election: Both transferor and transferee must file CRA Form T2057 by the earlier of their tax return deadlines for the year of transfer
