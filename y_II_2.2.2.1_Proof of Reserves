DON'T TRUST, VERIFY

Proof of Reserves research

--> Proof of Reserves
- A process used by companies to cryptographically and transparently verify that they hold the full amount of bitcoin they claim to possess
- Leverages transparency of the Bitcoin ledger to confirm wallet balances
- Distinct from traditional financial audits because it offers publicly verifiable evidence of asset ownership, rather than solely relying on accounting records


-> Why does it matter?
- Demonstrates to shareholders and the public that the company actually holds the bitcoin it claims to own
- Trust & credibility: assurance that the holdings are real and not misrepresented
- Market confidence and protection against rumours or questioning the integrity of the balance sheet


-> How is it best done?
- Cryptographic attestation using Merkle tree based proofs which verify reserves without revealing sensitive wallet details
- Employ digital signatures to prove control over Bitcoin addresses
- Quarterly POR attestation with timestamped blockchain data


--> What are the tradeoffs?
- Balancing the need for transparency with the need to protect sensitive information and assets
- Transparency benefits: builds trust, prevents stock price volatility from rumours or uncertainty, regulatory compliance
- Transparency risks: Privacy exposure (hacking risks or reveal of strategic moves), social engineering risks, operational complexity
- Balance of tradeoffs: partial disclosure with merkle tree roots or hashed wallet addresses to prove reserves without revealing full addresses
- Goal: minimize security risks while enabling verification



--> Conclusion
- PoR is a vital tool for a publicly traded Bitcoi treasury company to establish trust and maintain market confidence
- Competitive advantage to be first in doing PoR in a market. Demonstrates leadership, alignment with Bitcoin ethos of "don't trust, verify"
