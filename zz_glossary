GLOSSARY

--> Intrinsic value
- The perceived or calculated true worth of an asset based on its fundamental characteristics, independent of market price
- It represents the underlying value of a company, determined through an analysis of its financials
- Value investors like Graham or Buffett aim to estimate intrinsic value to identify stocks trading below their true worth which would be undervalued
- The goal is to buy undervalued stocks with a margin of safety, expecting the market price to eventually align with the intrinsic value over time
- BTC context: the intrinsic value of a stock is the number of sats per share


--> P/BYD (P-bid)

--> Proof of reserves


--> BTC torque (aka torque)
- Torque = BTC $ value divided by BTC Capital
- It's the return on invested capital (ROIC) for a Bitcoin Treasury
- Higher torque means every dollar raised to buy bitcoin produces many more dollars of btc value over time
- Said differently, BTC torque is how much btc $ value each invested dollar creates
- Insight: with common stock funding, torque only rises when equity trades at a premium.
- Insight: Common stock issuance is accretive only when the premium is high (>3 is a reasonable threshold)
- Insight: Preferreds create high torque witout requiring large equity premium (see torque library resource for logic) 

- Summary: BTC Torque reframes capital raising as a compounding engine rather than a one off dilution event 

BTC $ value = BTC $ gain + BTC $ income (cumulative value generation. Total value created from treasury operations)
BTC income = unrealized gain on the specific btc financed, minus financing costs, multiplied by an efficiency factor
mNAV = Enterprise value / BTC NAV (this is the "premium to NAV")
