Bitcoin Thesis [simple version]

The money is broken. Fiat melts at ~8% per year. Because they can't save in fiat, people save in real estate, stocks and fixed income.

Bitcoin is better money.

The monetary premium of the other assets is being siphoned into Bitcoin as people study and realize what Bitcoin is.

Bitcoin is on a path to becoming a $300 Trillion asset (~$14m per btc)

Over time it will eat golds lunch and then eat the monetary premium of everything else. 


NOTES:
- Bitcoin is digital gold
- Digital gold has superior monetary properties than analog gold including scarcity, portability, divisibility, durability, verifiability
- This makes digital gold an ideal treasury asset in an era of fiat currency devaluation
