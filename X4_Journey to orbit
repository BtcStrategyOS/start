The journey to orbit for a Bitcoin Treasury Company (BTC)

Launching a Bitcoin Treasury company is like launching a rocket into orbit

Orbit = reaching >$1b in btc holdings and achieving a sustainable flywheel effect with ATM and preferred offerings

Hypothesis: The first company in each major market to reach orbit will be very hard to catch and will likely capture a disproportionate amount of capital

- Prep 1_Construction: Engineer the rocket
- Prep 2_System checks: Ensure all systems are resilient and ignition ready
- Execution 1_Ignition: 
- Troposphere (surface to 12km): Densest layer (80% of atmosphere mass), weather phenomena
- Stratosphere (12-50km): 
- Mesosphere (50-85km): 
- Thermosphere (85-600km):
- Exosphere
- Orbit

RAW:

Physical challenges for a rocket: atmospheric density, drag, heating, fuel requirements

Challenges for a BTC: market conditions, costs of borrowing, increasing cost to acquire bitcoin, capital requirements

- Each layer of the atmosphere presents unique challenges to a rockets ascent
- Each stage of growth for a BTC also presents unique challenges to growth

Troposphere: 
- 0-1000 btc. competition, requires a lot of capital to get through resistance, requires stability control systems
- Most challenging layer to get through
- ATM engaged?
- break down ascent through troposphere into layers? T1, T2, T3

T1: 0 - 69 btc (14m mkt cap @$200k btc)
T2: 70 - 250 btc (50m mkt cap)
T3: 250 - 1000 btc (200m mkt cap)

Stratosphere:
- 1000-2100 btc
- air is thinner, more stable with less turbulence
- less competition, only 10% of companies will make it to stratosphere
- moderately challenging 

Mesosphere:
- 2100 - 4200 btc
- Boundary to space
- Less drag, reduction in difficulty of obtaining capital
- Transition to vacuuum: prepare to bring online preferreds
- lots of momentum, less fuel required to continue motion, btc price appreciation effect is major

Thermosphere:
- >5,000 btc (>$1b at $200k cad btc price)
- Orbital insertion

--
- Troposphere is the hardest due to high atmospheric density which causes drag and heating
- Statosphere is the second hardest due to high atmospheric density
