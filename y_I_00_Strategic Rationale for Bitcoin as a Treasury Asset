--> 1.1 Bitcoin as Digital Gold

Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, is the hardest asset in the world—scarce, portable, durable, and desirable. 

Unlike fiat currencies, which lose purchasing power due to inflation (e.g., USD’s 20%+ devaluation since 2020), Bitcoin’s decentralized protocol ensures resistance to monetary debasement. 

Its 3,200% price appreciation since 2020 and growing institutional adoption (e.g., BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust holding 706,008 BTC) validate its role as a superior store of value. 

By allocating corporate capital to Bitcoin, DIGI can protect it’s balance sheet from inflation and capture asymmetric upside potential.


--> 1.2 Strategy’s Performance

Since adopting Bitcoin in 2020, Strategy’s stock has risen 1,989%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 3.2x growth and Nvidia’s 1,165%. 

Market capitalization reached $117 billion by July 2025, driven by a 70–112% premium over net asset value (NAV). 

This premium reflects market confidence in their leveraged Bitcoin exposure and ability to raise capital efficiently. 

BTC Treasury Co's can replicate this model to transform their treasury into a growth engine, appealing to investors seeking Bitcoin exposure through traditional equity markets.
