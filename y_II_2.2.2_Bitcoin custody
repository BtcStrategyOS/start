Custody strategy: 

Vault architecture:
- Intstitutional grade multisig sub zero vault
- Keys held in different non-cooperating legal jurisdictions to maximize seizure resistance
- Insured holdings against theft/loss
- Bitcoin sent directly to vault after purchase
- Multiple approval required for transactions (Multiple institutions)
- Run a company node to verify all transactions
- UTXO formatting considered

Evaluate reputable enterprise grade custodians like Anchorwatch & OnRamp as potential custody partners
(Multi-jurisdictional multi-institution custody architecture is the gold standard)

Study proof of reserves as a transparency mechanism. Initiate conversation with Hoseku as verification partner

Engage and announce custody partner, proof of reserves partner

Design purchase protocol: bank account -> exchange -> routing wallet (UTXO formatting) -> vault -> verification of vault balance
