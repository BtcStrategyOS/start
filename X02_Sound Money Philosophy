--> A Philosophy of Sound Money


In a time economic volatility and centralized control over fiat currencies, a philosophy of sound money serves as a beacon of financial sovereignty and stability. 

Our investment strategy, centered on Bitcoin and gold, reflects a principled commitment to preserving wealth through assets that embody the core tenets of sound money: scarcity, durability, divisibility, portability, and intrinsic value. 

This thesis outlines our philosophy, rooted in historical wisdom and forward-looking innovation, to champion a monetary system that empowers individuals and withstands the erosive forces of inflation and mismanagement.



Sound money isn't merely a financial instrument; it's a moral and economic imperative. 

Historically, the relative scarcity and durability of gold enabled it to become a trusted store of value for millennia. 

It's scarcity, enforced by nature, resists arbitrary manipulation, while its durability ensures wealth preservation across generations. 

However, gold has several limitations - It's weight, storage challenges, and indivisibility for small transactions have prompted the exploration of complementary assets in the digital age. 

In the wake of the 2009 financial crisis, Bitcoin was created.

Bitcoin is a decentralized, mathematically constrained digital currency that mirrors gold’s scarcity while offering unparalleled portability and divisibility. 

With a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s protocol enforces scarcity through cryptographic consensus, immune to the whims of central banks or governments.



Our philosophy is grounded in the belief that sound money will resist inflationary debasement. 

Fiat currencies, subject to unchecked money printing, have historically eroded purchasing power.

The supply of Canadian dollars has doubled in the past 5 years - a 14% annual inflation rate over that time period. 

Far above the average growth rate of 8.5% from 1971 to 2025 and likely an indicator of accelerating monetary debasement.

Gold and Bitcoin, by contrast, are deflationary by design. 

Bitcoin’s halving mechanism reduces issuance every four years, and gold’s labor-intensive extraction process ensures that supply growth remains constrained. 

This scarcity fosters trust, as neither asset can be arbitrarily diluted to fund deficits or bailouts.



Furthermore, sound money empowers individuals over institutions. 

Bitcoin’s decentralized network, secured by miners and nodes worldwide, eliminates reliance on intermediaries, granting users direct control over their wealth. 

Gold, while requiring physical custody, offers similar autonomy, free from counterparty risk. 

Both assets align with our mission to provide investors with financial sovereignty, shielding them from systemic risks inherent in centralized banking systems, as evidenced by the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent quantitative easing.



Critics argue that Bitcoin’s volatility and gold’s lack of yield undermine their utility. 

We counter that volatility is a symptom of nascent adoption, and Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory reflects growing recognition of its value proposition. 

Gold’s stability, meanwhile, complements Bitcoin’s growth potential, creating a balanced portfolio that hedges against both inflation and economic uncertainty. 

Together, they form a dual-asset strategy that transcends the limitations of fiat systems, offering resilience in an era of negative real interest rates and ballooning national debts.


Our philosophy of sound money is a call to return to first principles: money should be a reliable store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account, free from manipulation and rooted in scarcity. 

By investing in Bitcoin and gold, we embrace a future where wealth is protected not by promises of institutions but by the immutable laws of mathematics and nature. 

This is our vision—a world where sound money restores trust, fosters freedom, and secures prosperity for future generations.
