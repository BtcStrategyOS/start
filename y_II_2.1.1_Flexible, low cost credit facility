Secured: less risk to borrower, lower interest rate on the loan. Requires conservative use of credit with utility limits and LTV constraints (20-50%?)
- Mechanism: secured with bitcoin purchased with credit facility. Funds held in a segregated vault, lender is senior on the vault in case of liquidation
- Risk: btc draws down, must be liquidated to repay loan at a loss
- Risk mitigation: Flexible, intelligent terms with 4+ year time horizon. btc draw down enables more btc acquired with weekly DCA

Unsecured: more risk to borrower, higher interest rate on the loan, reduced arbitrage opportunity


Action: Engage investment banks to assess availability and terms of credit facility
