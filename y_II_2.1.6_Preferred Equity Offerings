RAW:

Strategy introduced perpetual preferred stock offerings in 2025 to diversify its capital base and minimize common stock dilution. Reaching a treasury size that permits the issuance of preferred equity and employing these instruments will be critical for our long term strategy:


12.00% Series A Perpetual SXXI Preferred Stock: (senior in capital stack, STRF template)
  
Details: Offer a fixed 12% annual dividend paid quarterly at $21 per share. Include a redemption floor to protect investors. Aim is to outperform traditional preferred offerings. 
 
Features: High fixed yield appeals to income-seeking investors, while Bitcoin correlation provides capital appreciation potential. SXXI’s structure balances yield stability with Bitcoin exposure.

Action: Launch $21m million fixed-dividend preferred stock offering at 10-12% yield, targeting hedge funds and high-net-worth individuals. Ensure Nasdaq listing for liquidity.






Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC):
  
Details: Launched July 2025, raising $2.5 billion by selling 28 million shares at $90 each. STRC pays monthly, board-adjusted dividends targeting income-focused investors and trades on Nasdaq.
 
Features: Adjustable dividend rates (e.g., 8–10% based on market conditions) provide flexibility, while perpetual maturity avoids repayment pressure. STRC’s performance tracks Bitcoin’s volatility, appreciating 5% above its initial value by July 2025.
  
Action: Issue a similar perpetual preferred stock with variable dividends (6–8%) to attract institutional investors. Structure with a redemption floor to limit downside risk.


Convertible Preferred Stock (STRK):
 
Details: Introduced in Q1 2025, STRK raised $584 million at $80 per share with a 10:1 conversion ratio to common stock. It offers an 8% dividend yield and trades at $85 as of July 2025, reflecting strong market demand.

Features: Conversion feature aligns with common stock upside, while dividends provide downside protection. STRK’s 51% year-to-date gain underscores its appeal as a hybrid instrument.
 
Action: Issue a $200 million convertible preferred stock with a 7–9% yield and 10:1 conversion ratio, targeting arbitrage funds and crypto-focused investors.
