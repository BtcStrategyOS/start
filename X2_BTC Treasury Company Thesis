Mission: Outperform Bitcoin by arbitraging the difference between the cost of capital and the return of bitcoin. 

How: Activate flywheel via cheap debt + intelligent leverage.

Doing so generates a premium to asset value which can be transmuted into more bitcoin per share for investors. 

King metric: BTC yield (rate of increase in sats per share over time)

Assumptions:

1. Bitcoin price appreciation
2. Access to cheap capital (borrow at low rate convertible notes and issue equity at premium valuations to fund Bitcoin purchases)
3. Market premium sustainability (must maintain premium over NAV to keep flywheel in motion)
4. Operational stability (strategy to service debt and conservative leverage to mitigate downside risks, bitcoin treasury secured within insured multisig sub zero institutional grade vaults)

Real World Validation:

Since 2020, MSTR has grown over 1989%, outperforming Bitcoins 3.2x and even Nvidiaâ€™s 1,165% gain

This validates the thesis within a bullish sentiment. 

Inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 in 2024 further validates with capital flows entering from passive index funds.
