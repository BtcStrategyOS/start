**Bitcoin Denominated Convertible Bond**

Innovated by The Smarter Web Company & named "Smarter Convert", this is a creative way to raise money without paying interest.

Unique element: denominated in btc, not fiat. Bonds value is tied to btc but share conversion price stays fixed in fiat.

DETAILS

Conversion option: Investors can swap their bonds for shares at a 5% premium to current share price

Forced conversion (FC): After 6 months, if the share price climbs to 50% above conversion price for 10 days, company can force convert to shares instead of cash

Repayment: If investors don't convert within 12 months, company pays back 98% of the bonds value in bitcoin*

*Repayment amount depends on the price of bitcoin. Higher btc value = higher repayment. Lower btc value = lower repayment

*If btc goes up or down, company obligation in btc terms doesnt change, already has btc in reserve

Scenario modeling

Worst case: share price stays low, after 12 months the company pays back 98% of the bitcoin invested (2% to cover costs)

Best case: share price goes up, investors choose conversion option or are forced to convert if FC conditions met

In best case, the company raises money at a higher price, issuing fewer new shares vs normal stock sale (less dilution of current shareholders)

-
Impact on the company

News shares: If all bonds convert into shares, new shares will be issued

BTC holdings: company adds more btc to treasury

-
Why its relevant

--> WHY?

Zero risk for company

Win-win architecture: investors get protection if price doesn't go up, company raises at a premium if things work out

Less dilutive to current shareholders vs. normal stock sale

By making bond denominated in btc, investors are:
- Buying btc exposure for 12 months
- Getting upside company exposure with minimal downside risk


--> HOW?

Investors offer fiat funding to company, converted immediately into btc for the treasury

If the bond converts, investors receive new shares at a 5% premium

Better than equity raise becaiuse it's at a premium above the market close price

Accretive to shareholders if convert price is at mNAV premium (ideally >3)


--> WHAT?

A convertible bond^1 denominated in btc^2


1: investors can convert their investment into company shares instead of getting cash back)
2: If the bond doesn't convert, company returns 98% of the btc they got from converting investment amount into bitcoin
