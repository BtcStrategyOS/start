Bitcoin is more than just money. It is a moral code. 

It is a social operating system for humanity built on truth, integrity and mathematics.

It enshrines property rights for every humnan and democratizes cyber self defence via encryption.

Bitcoin is a moral imperative. Accelerating it's adoption is a moral duty and a virtuous act.
