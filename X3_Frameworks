Bitcoin Flywheel

- Self reinforcing cycle that gains momentum over time
- Creates a virtuous loop of value creation and capital appreciation through Bitcoin adoption
- A strategic framework to leverage corporate structure, financial engineering & Bitcoin price appreciation
- Result: continously acquire more bitcoin, increase shareholder value, strengthen balance sheet, attract more capital
- Each component reinforces the others, creating a positive feedback loop which accelerates accumulation of Bitcoin

Flywheel anatomy (interconnected components that work together to perpetuate and accelerate the cycle)
- Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset
- Capital raising through debt and equity
- Bitcoin price appreciation
- Shareholder value (stock price increase) enables further capital raising via equity at favourable valuations to buy more bitcoin
- ?Operational cashflow to service debt or fund additional bitcoin purchases

The flywheel acts as a self-reinforcing cycle where each component drives the next

Risks: Bitcoin price volatility, debt burden, dilution
Mitigation: Long term time horizon, conservative debt thresholds, equity issuance only at favourable valuations (>2.5 mNAV)
